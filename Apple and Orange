Function Description

Complete the countApplesAndOranges function in the editor below. It should print the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house, each on a separate line.

countApplesAndOranges has the following parameter(s):

    s: integer, starting point of Sam's house location.
    t: integer, ending location of Sam's house location.
    a: integer, location of the Apple tree.
    b: integer, location of the Orange tree.
    apples: integer array, distances at which each apple falls from the tree.
    oranges: integer array, distances at which each orange falls from the tree.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of s and t
The second line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of a and b
The third line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of and m and n.
The fourth line contains m space-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each apple falls from point a .
The fifth line contains nspace-separated integers denoting the respective distances that each orange falls from point b.

Output Format

Print two integers on two different lines:

    The first integer: the number of apples that fall on Sam's house.
    The second integer: the number of oranges that fall on Sam's house.

Sample Input 0

7 11
5 15
3 2
-2 2 1
5 -6

Sample Output 0

1
1

Explanation 0

The first apple falls at position 5-2=3
.
The second apple falls at position 5+2=7.
The third apple falls at position 5+1=6.
The first orange falls at position 15+5=20.
The second orange falls at position 15-9=6.
Only one fruit (the second apple) falls within the region between 7 and 11, so we print 1as our first line of output.
Only the second orange falls within the region between 7 and 11 , so we print 1 as our second line of output.
